##FAQ
###What does Rumil mean?
Rumil is a character in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. He was a Noldorin sage who invented the first writing system.

###Yet another editor?
Yes. This project is largely just me trying to improve my C.

###Is Rumil modal?
No. While I am a user of a modal editor myself, I am trying to keep Rumil as accesible as possible, and modal editors do introduce a steep learning curve.

###Odludl!
Atlatl!

##Keystrokes

^someletter = Control + someletter
F# = Function key (1-12)

Rumil | JOE | GNU Moe | Action  | Why this keystroke?
---|-----|------|---------------|---------------------
^Q | ^_  | F7   | Undo          | Because three keys is too much for an operation as common as undo/redo, and function keys are too far away
^W | ^^  | F8   | Redo          | ''
F1 | ^KH | F1   | Help          | Because F1 is the key most people will look for when seeking help
^X | ^X  | None | Next word     | One of the moves I use most, so easily reachable with one hand
^Z | ^Z  | None | Previous word | ''
^O | ^KU | ^[U  | Beg. of file  | Rarely used actions; put next to each other.
^P | ^KV | ^[V  | End of file   | ''
